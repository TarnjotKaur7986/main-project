<h2>Food Safety Guidelines</h2>
<p>Ensuring food safety is important to protect your health and well-being. Here are some rules to follow:</p>
<p>Be thoughtful about safe eating practices to help reduce risk of choking, manage food allergy and maintain kitchen safety.</p>


    <p>For young children, choose snacks based on your child’s eating ability to help reduce the risk of choking. Children
         should always be seated,supervised when eating and chew well before swallowing. Learn more about certain foods that 
         should be avoided by young children.</p>
<p>If managing a food allergy, always carefully read ingredient information on packaged food labels every time you purchase 
    foods to avoid potential allergens. Read the ingredient statement including the “contains” statement and precautionary 
    allergen labeling (such as “may contain” or “manufactured on shared equipment”).</p>
<p>When preparing and serving foods, wash hands, sanitize surfaces, use care and adult supervision with knives and kitchen equipment,
 and serve hot and cold foods at safe temperatures.</p>
<p>By following these guidelines, you can reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses and enjoy your meals safely.</p>
